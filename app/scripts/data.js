		bio: 'In 1888 Vincent van Gogh painted Van Gogh\'s Chair as one of two unusual portraits depicting himself and his friend Paul Gauguin. For his own portrait, van Gogh used one of the twelve simple chairs he had purchased when he furnished the Yellow House. His pipe and a pouch of tobacco on the rush seat and the box of onions that bears his name serve as rustic attributes that contrast to the more elegant items he chose to represent Paul Gauguin. The predominant hue in Van Gogh\'s Chair is yellow, which van Gogh now regarded as his signature color.',
